<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> 1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Historically, travel time decay curves have been estimated via exponential regression on time. First, for each time <em>t</em> in a set of travel times <span class="math inline">\({\scriptstyle t = 1, 2, ..., t_{max}}\)</span>, number of trips lasting at least <em>t</em> minutes would be calculated. Then, assuming the functional form y = Aebt, a regression would be fit with <em>t</em> (time) as the sole explanatory variable and <em>y</em> (the number of trips lasting at least <em>t</em> minutes) as the response.</p>
<p>While this method does elucidate the underlying decay curve, it is a naive approach in that it assumes travel time decay relies only on time. By considering time as the only covariate, this type of model ignores the impact other variables could have on travel time decay. For example, increased age could be associated with shorter tripmaking for walking trips, and thus a steeper travel time decay. Thus, a more informative travel time decay model may seek to include the effects of both time and other relevant covariates. This would not only produce a more realistic travel time decay curve, but allow for a quantification of the relationship between included covariates and travel time decay.</p>
<p>This paper suggests the use of a survival analysis approach to modeling travel time decay. Survival analysis encompasses a set of statistical methods interested in modeling the time to an “event” using a set of predictor variables. It is most often seen in clinical trials, where a researcher may be interested in how long patients survive after being given a particular treatment. It can be extended to travel time decay by considering the ending of a trip as the “event” of interest. Table 1 provides the travel time decay analogs of a more common survival analysis example.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> 2. DATA</h2>
<p>The data comes from the Massachusetts Travel Survey (MTS), conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and published in June 2012. It was provided by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), which serves Boston, MA and its metropolitan region.</p>
<p>The data includes 190,215 trip records from 37,023 persons across 15,033 households in Massachusetts. The trip dataset includes attributes such as duration, mode, purpose, cost, destination, etc. The person dataset includes attributes such as age, education, employment status, etc. The household dataset includes size, number of workers, number of vehicles, income, location, etc.</p>
<p>This analysis required known values for all model variables, so some trip records were filtered out prior to model fitting based on survey responses. In addition, models were fit individually on different classes of modes, so different filtering conditions were necessary to create each model set. Table 2 details the modes used for each model, the conditions on which model variables were filtered, and the resulting number of trip records used for model fitting.</p>

<div id="the-cox-proportional-hazards-model" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.1</span> 3.1 THE COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL</h3>
<p>Of particular interest for travel time decay modeling is the Cox proportional hazards model (henceforth referred to as the Cox model). The Cox model is, in essense, a multivariate regression. It attempts to model the <em>hazard function h(t)</em> using a set of predictor variables. The hazard function can then be used to calculate the <em>survival function S(t)</em>, or the probability that a trip lasts longer than <em>t</em>. Though hazard is <em>not</em> a probability, it is helpful to think of hazard as the probability that a trip will end in an infinitesimally small time window <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle [t, t + δt]\)</span>, provided that the trip has lasted until time <em>t</em>. In other words, it is the instantaneous risk of a trip ending, given that it has lasted to that point. The mathematical relationship between the survival function and the hazard function is <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle S(t) = e^{−\int^t_0 h(y)dy}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle \int^t_0 h(y)dy\)</span> is the cumulative hazard function, or the total accumulated risk up to time t. Details are left out for clarity, but this is based on the definition of <em>h(t)</em> as a limit of event probability as <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle δ → 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Cox model is multiplicative, in that it assumes a multiplicative relationship between the covariates and the hazard. It takes the following form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h(t|x_{i1}, ...x_{ip}) = h0(t) ∗ e^{β1xi1+...+βpxip} \]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>t is time,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle h(t|xi)\)</span> is the hazard function for trip <em>i</em> with covariates <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle xi1, ..., xip\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle h0(t)\)</span> is the baseline hazard function,</li>
<li><em>βj</em> is the effect of the <em>j</em> th covariate, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle x_{ij}\)</span> is the value of the <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle j^{th}\)</span> covariate for the <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle i^{th}\)</span> trip</li>
</ul>
<p>An important feature of the Cox model is that <em>the baseline hazard function is not specified.</em> This is due to the <em>proportional hazards assumption:</em> the ratio of hazards between two unique observations should <strong>not</strong> rely on time. For example, if after 15 minutes, a walking trip taken by a 60 year old carries twice the risk of ending as a walking trip taken by a 20 year old, it should also carry twice the risk after 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or indeed any other time. Non-proportional hazards may be thought of as an interaction between a covariate and time. Because hazards are all proportional under the proportional hazards assumption, the baseline hazard is arbitrary.</p>
<p>The Cox model is “semi-parametric”, in that it requires no assumptions about the baseline hazard function. Parametric methods can be used if the baseline hazard itself is of interest, and these methods indeed rely on specifying a distribution for the baseline hazard (common selections include the Exponential, Weibull, and Lognormal distributions). Though these models have more power when this distribution is correctly specified, they are not robust to misspecifications, and thus are highly risky. For this particular application of travel time decay curves, the baseline hazard was not of particular interest, and it sufficed to assume a general decrease in trip survival with time in the absence of covariate information (as is the outcome of Cox modeling). However, it stands to reason that understanding the baseline hazard may be of interest in other travel time decay modeling applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="selectin-of-covariates" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.2</span> 3.2 SELECTIN OF COVARIATES</h3>
<p>Covariates to be considered for each mode-specific model were selected from the set of available attributes in the trip, person, and household datasets reviewed in the Data section. Importantly, only covariates that would be (1) known for a given trip/person/household in a predictive setting or (2) easy to estimate for a given trip/person/household were selected for the model. These conditions were established for easier use of final model in practice. For example, though it is easy to see how age may be a relevant predictor of travel time decay for walking trips (older people may tend to take shorter trips, for example), it is unlikely a trip taker’s age is a readily available data point in a predictive setting. Furthermore, attempts to predict age for inclusion in a final model could be complicated and add uncertainty to travel time decay estimates.</p>
<p>Table 3 details the candidate covariates considered for each mode-specific model.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert table 3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In all models, trip purpose was collapsed from 24 categories provided in the MTS data to three broad “purpose groups”: home, work, and non-work. Table 4 details how purposes were collapsed. “Loop trips” were classified according to their secondary purpose (which were also coded according to Table 4), or filtered out if no secondary purpose was provided.</p>

</div>
<div id="initial-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.3</span> 3.3 INITIAL MODELS</h3>
<p>Initial model fitting began by including all candidate covariates for each mode-specific model a linear form (see Table 3). Backward selection was applied to create a “statistically valid” model – one with only significant covariates. Backward selection involves iteratively eliminating the least significant covariate from the model [from the set of insignificant covarites], and refitting the model until all remaining covariates are significant. If all variables were significant in the first model fit, backwards selection was not applied, as there was no need for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-proportional-hazards-assumption" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.4</span> 3.4 THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ASSUMPTION</h3>
<p>Though there are multiple assumptions underlying the Cox model, by far the most important assumption is that of proportional hazards (see Section 3.1, The Cox proportional hazards model). Without this assumption, the Cox model is uninterpretable and completely invalid. Exploration of model diagnostics thus began with the proportional hazards assumption, and proceeded to other assumptions only once proportional hazards was verified.</p>
<p>The proportional hazards assumption was tested for each covariate using the <em>Schoenfeld Residuals Test</em> (also known as the <em>Schoenfeld Individual Test</em>). The null hypothesis of this test is that time and scaled Schoenfeld residuals are uncorrelated, which should be true in the case of proportional hazards. The alternative hypothesis is that time and scaled Schoenfeld residuals are correlated. Thus, a significant result indicates that a lack of proportional hazards - this would indicate the model results are dependent on time. If no time dependence was observed in any covariate at <em>α</em> = 0.05, diagnostics proceeded to validation of other assumptions. Otherwise, a new model accounting for time dependence was fit.</p>
<div id="time--dependent-models" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">0.3.4.1</span> 3.4.1 TIME- DEPENDENT MODELS</h4>
<p>Multiple strategies exist to account for time dependence in Cox models. One such method is the use of “time-dependent coefficients”, which involves unique effect sizes for covariates depending on the period of time. Essentially, time-dependent coefficients create a step function of survival time, where each covariate is time-independent within each step. This is particularly relevant and interpretable in the context of travel time decay, be ause it allows for a sense of “bracketing” trip times, and understanding unique effects across travel times. Again, consider the theoretical use of age as a covariate in predicting walking travel time decay. For very short trips, there is likely a minimal effect of age (if any), as all people are likely equally comfortable walking less than five minutes. For longer trips, however, the effect size might increase, as young adults may be comfortable walking 20-30 minutes while senior citizens are not.</p>
<p>To fit a time-dependent coefficients model, variables for which the Schoenfeld Residuals test was significant at <em>α</em> = 0.05 were explored visually using plots of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time. This graphical exploration demonstrated the functional form of the effect of these covariates over time, informing decisions on potential break points for intervals in which covariates may be time-independent. Interval break points were also subject to the researcher’s discretion of an “interpretable interval”: in other words, intervals would be created on 5 or 10 minute break points rather than odd-valued break points which would have less practical significance</p>
<p>Once interval break points were identified, the data was reconfigured with dummy entries to reflect the selected intervals. For example, if trip <em>T</em> lasted 16 minutes, and intervals of 0-10 minutes and 10-20 minutes were identified from the plots, trip <em>T</em> would be split into two entries <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle T_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle T_2\)</span>. Trip <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle T_1\)</span> would start at 0 minutes, go until 10 minutes, and would not end (i.e. would not experience an “event”); trip <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle T_2\)</span> would start at 10 minutes, go until 20 minutes, and end somewhere in that interval (i.e. would experience an “event”). A time-dependent model was then fit on this reconfigured “interval” data, and the Schoenfeld Residuals Test was again applied to observe if any time dependence remained. This process was repeated until all time dependence was eliminated, yielding a model which adhered to the proportional hazards assumption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="other-diagnostics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.5</span> 3.5 OTHER DIAGNOSTICS</h3>
<p>In addition to the proportional hazards assumption, the Cox model also makes assumptions similar to those of standard regression. For this analysis, diagnostics for the assumptions of (1) no outliers in the data and (2) proper functional form of continuous covariates (which, in this case, was linear) were explored. These two assumptions were checked only after proportional hazards had been verified, either in a standard model or in a time-dependent coefficients model.</p>
<div id="outliers" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">0.3.5.1</span> 3.5.1 OUTLIERS</h4>
<p>Outliers were explored using a plot of the deviance residuals against the index of the residuals. Unusually large positive or negative deviance residuals were indicative of an outlier (large positive-valued deviance residuals indicate a trip that ended far earlier than expected according to the model, while large negativevalued residuals indicate a trip that ended far later than expected according to the model). Trips that were considered outliers by this visual exploration were looked at individually for an inclusion/exclusion decision.</p>
<p>Given that the trips all came from the same survey and the same state, outlier points would rarely be considered erroneous or apart from the population of interest, and thus would only be excluded in a very extreme case.</p>
</div>
<div id="linearity-of-continuous-covariates" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">0.3.5.2</span> 3.5.2 LINEARITY OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES</h4>
<p>Linearity of continuous covariates was explored using plots of martingale residuals of a “null Cox model” (including only one covariate) against that covariate. If the relationship between that covariate and hazard is truly linear, then a linear trend should be evident in the plot; otherwise, a different functional form may represent a better fit. If necessary, better fits were explored by fitting a new “null Cox model” with a different functional form of the covariate.</p>
<p>Like with outliers, the functional form of a variable would be changed only in a very extreme case, where the deviation from a linear relationship was severe or the use of a nonlinear relationship was obvious. The use of linearity between a covariate and hazard rate does not necessarily make the model wrong if it is not the true relationship, but rather indicates that a better fit may be available. However, estimating the true functional form could be a time-consuming challenge if the relationship is especially complicated, and such an endeavor is likely unnecessary for this particular analysis. In addition, linear relationships will be more easily interpretable, which is a primary goal of this model.</p>

<p>The model including all candidate covariates produced a statistically valid fit, so no backward selection was completed.

The model coefficients are provided in Table 5, while the hazard ratios are provided in Table 6.</p>

<p>Schoenfeld Residuals Tests on the covariates revealed time dependence in all covariates. The results of the test are shown in Table 7 (the <strong>Global</strong> row contains the results of a global test on the model, which tests if there is any time dependence in the model as a whole).

<p>Plots of null Cox model Martingale residuals against parking cost, toll cost, household size, origin and destination TAZ parking, and origin and destination TAZ terminal time revealed no drastic deviations from linearity, so no functional forms were changed in the time-dependent model.

For this analysis, linearity was deemed “close enough” in the context of time and processing limitations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.2</span> 5.2 A WALKTHROUGH EXAMPLE</h3>
<p>To exemplify this operationalization, imagine that we want to quantify the value of a 15 minute vehicle trip in the context of increasing tolls. The null case <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_0\)</span> will assume no tolls. It will be compared to three alternative cases <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_{A_i},=1,2,3\)</span> , where <em>i</em> represents a $1, $2, or $3 toll, respectively. All other model variables will be held constant. Table 15 details the covariates in each case.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert table 15&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The first step involves calculating the proportion of people willing to travel 15 minutes, or <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle S_{C_0}(14)\)</span>. Using the personal vehicle model, we predict a survival curve using the conditions in <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_0\)</span>, and extract the survival probability at <em>t</em> = 14. We find that <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle S_{C_0}(14)\)</span>. A visualization is provided in Figure <strong>XXX</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert figure xxx&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, the probabilities that a trip lasts 15 minutes must be calculated in each alternative case, and then compared to the same probability in the null case. Using the personal vehicle model, we predict survivalcurves for <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_{A_1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_{A_2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_{A_3}\)</span>, and calculate <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle f_{CA}(15)\)</span> according to the survival probabilities at <em>t</em> = 14, 15.</p>
<p>We refer back to the null case survival curve to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle f_{C_0}(15)\)</span> in the same manner. Finally, we take the ratio of each fCAi(15) <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle f_{C_{A_i}}(15)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle f_{C_{0_i}}(15)\)</span>. The results are provided in Table <strong>XXX</strong>. For context, the null and alternative case probability density functions on t ∈ [10, 20] are shown in Figure <strong>XXX2</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert table xxx&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert figure xxx2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Final, the decay factor <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle D_{15,{C_0,C_{A_i}}}=S_{C_0}(14) \bullet \frac{f_{C_A}(15)}{f_{{C_0}(15)}}\)</span> is calculated fro all three <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle C_{A_i}\)</span>. The results are provided in Table <strong>XXX2</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;insert table xxx2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So, it is learned that, without even considering toll increases, 15 minute trips are de-valued (relative to a less-than-1 minute trip) by a factor of about 0.65 based on time alone. The impact of the toll increase on a 15 minute trip is negligible at $1 (estimated 0.97 times the 15 minute trips), but is notable at $2 and $3 (estimated 0.68 and 0.46 times the 15 minute trips, respectively). It can be concluded that, for the about 65% of travelers willing to take a 15 minute trip, a $1 toll does not drastically alter accessibility, but that a $2 or more toll does.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.6</span> 6 CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model offers an improvement over classical travel time decay modeling methods by allowing for the inclusion of covariate information and quantifying effect sizes associated with these covariates. Furthermore, the use of time-dependent coefficients in these Cox models allows for an interval understanding of covariate effects, which is particularly useful in travel time since trips are often thought of in 5 or 10 minute intervals. The Cox models fit in this analysis indicate that, depending on the mode of choice, trip purpose, trip cost, and household size may all be significant contributors to trip hazard rate and, consequently, trip survival time. These covariates represent a suite of information that should be readily available for use of these modeling in a predictive or simulative context.</p>
<p>Future models should seek to explore additional relevant covariate information (such as terminal time) and/or potential interactions between covariates. They also may seek the following modeling improvements, which were not addressed in this analysis due to processing and time constraints.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Use of a smoothed function for time-dependent coefficients, as opposed to a step function:</em> Rather than estimating coefficients in discrete time intervals, coefficients could be estimated using a smoothed function of time. For example, in the case of monotonically decreasing effect size with time, a linear function could be valid. This could improve accuracy in estimating effect sizes</li>
<li><em>Estimation of proper functional form for continuous covariates:</em> Rather than assuming a basic linear form for continuous covariates, more representative functional forms could be estimated using smoothing techniques, for example. This would improve understanding of the relationship between the covariates and hazard, as well as likely improve predictive accuracy.</li>
</ol>
