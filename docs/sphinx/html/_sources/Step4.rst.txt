Step 4 - Trip Generation
============================

Trip generation proceeds in two parts:

Trips by zone
----------------
This script estimates trip generation for home-based trip productions and
non-home-based trip attractions.

Home-based productions are stratified by household type. 
  - Reads estimates of households in each zone across 4 dimensions
      - HH size (1, 2, 3, 4+)
      - Number of workers (0, 1, 2, 3+)
      - Income group (1, 2, 3, 4)
      - Vehicle ownership (0, 1, 2, 3+)
  - Reads trip generation rates and seed data for household cross-class
  - Cross-classifies households into 256 HH types using IPF

Attractions are estimated based on destination activities (jobs by type,
school enrollments, etc.)

Non-home-based productions are estimated based on household variables but
redistributed to match the spatial allocation implied by non-home generators.

This script needs to be run for each land use configuration. Results are
stored in the "lu" folder corresponding to each land use configuration.
Results generated include: 
    
    - **hh_by_type_sum.csv**: csv
        Summary table of households by type by focus and window area 
        inclusion (for high-level QA of results).
        
    - **trip_gen_summary.csv**: csv
        Summary table of trips by purpose and end by focus and window area
        inclusion.
        
    - **trips_by_zone.csv**: csv
        TAZ-level tabulation of trips by purpose and end.
    
    - **HHs_by_type_taz.h5**: LbArray
        cross-classified households by type in each taz.
    
    - **trips_by_taz.h5**: LbArray
        trip productions and attractions by purpose and household type in
        each taz.

Trips by block (in window)
---------------------------
This script estimates block-level trips by household type and non-home 
attractions based on TAZ-level trip estimates and block-level activity
estimates. This is accomplished in 5 major steps:
    
    1. Estimate activity-based block trip gen propensity by purpose
        - Propensities are estimated such that every block has an extremely
          small starting propensity, and this grows based on block activities.
          This is to alleviate potential discontinuities between block-level
          and TAZ-level activity estimates.
           - Production propensity is informed by HH types
           - Attraction propensity is informed by job types and enrollments
        
    2. Summarize total block trip-making propensity by purpose
        - Summarize the activity-based propensities to yield the total
          trip-making propensity for the block.The resultsing score is the
          total trip gen propensity (either for P's or A's) by purpose.
        - Summarize the block-level totals to TAZs. This will be used to
          determine each block's share of total trip-making propensity.
          
    3. Normalize the activity-based propensities such that they sum to 1.0
       within each block.
        - When each block's trip total is estimated, these shares will
          determine trips by activity type.
    
    4. Summarize block-level total trip propensity to TAZ and estimate block-
        level shares of TAZ totals (by purpose and trip-end) by activity.
        
    5. Multiply TAZ-level trip estimates by purpose and trip-end to block-
       level, activity-based normalized propensities. This yields activity-
       based trips by block.
