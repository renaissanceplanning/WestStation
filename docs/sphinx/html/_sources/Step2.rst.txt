Step 2 - Import Skims
======================

This script reads skim data from csv files into the emma.od.Skim format
for use in accessibility and downstream travel modeling analyses.

Modes of travel for which skim data are provided include:
    - Auto (SOV)
    - Transit
        - Walk access (all technologies)
        - Drive access (various technologies)
            - Commuter rail
            - Ferry
            - Local bus
            - Rapid transit
    - Bicyling
    - Walking
    
The typical procedure for translating skim data from tables to Skim matrices
includes:
    - Identifying the csv data source
    - Defining the origin_id and destination_id columns in the csv
    - Defining the Skim zones index and axis labels
    - Define how value columns in the csv relate to axes
    - Initialize the skim object (pointing to an HDF store if desired)
    - Import data

Workflow:

- Specify the network configuration and lu configuration (for parking costs and terminal times, e.g.)
- Specify global assumptions
- Import auto travel costs from csv
   - Calculate TAZ-level walking and biking costs 
   - Add parking and terminal times
   - Estimate parking durations / typical charges
   - Calculate generalized cost by purpose
- Import transit (WAT) costs from csv
   - Calculate total travel time from IVTT + OVTT
- Import transit (DAT) costs from csv
   - Calculate total times by submode
   - Generalize best available DAT costs
- Import walk travel costs from csv (block level)
- Import bike travel costs from csv (block level)
