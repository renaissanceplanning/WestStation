West Station Area Multimodal Accessibility Analysis
=======================================================

There are 7 main steps executed in 8 scripts:

1. **Clean skims** (`Step1_CleanSkims.py`) - process csv OD tables to ensure
   column names are consistent across scenarios and extraneous rows are 
   excluded.

2. **Import skims** (`Step2_ImportSkims.py`) - convert csv OD tables to emma
   `Skim` objects for all modes. Calculate derived values, such as generalized
   cost.

3. **Summarize access** (`Step3_SummarizeAccess.py`) - using skims and tabular
   activity data by zone, summarize access to jobs, enrollments, etc.

4. **Trip generation**

    a. *Regional trips* (`Step4_TripGen.py`) - use regional trip generation
       rates and TAZ-level activity data to estimate person trip productions
       and attractions.
    
    b. *Window trips* (`Step4_TripGenDisag.py`) - use block-level activity
       data and assumptions about trip-making propensity to disaggregate
       productions and attractions from the TAZ level to the block level in
       the window area.

5. **Mode choice** (`Step5_ModeChoice.py`) - use access scores and demographic
   data to apply a series of mode choice models to estimate productions and
   attractions by mode for TAZs (region) and blocks (window).

6. **Distribution** (`Step6_Distribution.py`) - estimate trip OD patterns by
   mode and purpose for a given time period, applying K factors if specified.

7. **Estimate TNC trips** (`Step7_TNC.py`) - use assumptions about TNC costs,
   utilization by purpose, trip substitution by mode, and decay rates to
   identify OD pairs with high probabilities to substitute trips by a given
   mode for TNC trips.
