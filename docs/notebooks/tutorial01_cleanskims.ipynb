    "# Clean skims\n",
    "Skim data used in the West Station Area study were provided as csv files. These are imported into emma's `Skim` class. However, in some cases, the raw skim data needed to be tidied up. For example, transit skims often include records for all possible origin-destination pairs, even though only a fraction of these pairs are actually connected by transit. Removing pairs where no transit connections are available speeds up the import process. \n",

During the West Station Study, inconsistencies in column names were observed for the \"Generalized Cost\", \"Total Cost\", and \"Access Drive Distance\" fields for transit skims. Renaming conventions were applied to set columns to \"GenCost\", \"TotCost\", and \"DriveDist\" respectively. Column renaming specs are provided in a dictionary. The dictionary only needs to include columns to be renamed (all others will remain as they are found) and can include column names that aren't found in the csv file (these are simply ignored). Thus, a comprehensive renaming dicionary can be built to cover the bases during the skim cleaning process."
